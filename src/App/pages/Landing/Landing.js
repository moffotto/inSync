                                Cloud computing services have become a fundamental component of modern business. With more and more specialized services being offered, the complexity that developers must face every day only grows. This complexity leads to insecure platforms and compromised code.

Through the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, developers learn how to secure their own applications.

The storyline for this application is that of a new startup offering the ability to detect these food classifications through the use of "computer vision techniques" and "smart AI technologies".</p>
